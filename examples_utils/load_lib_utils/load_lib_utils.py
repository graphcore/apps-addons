def load_lib(filepath: str, timeout: int = 5 * 60):
    """Compile a C++ source file using `cppimport`, load the shared library into the process using `ctypes` and
    return it.

    Compilation is not triggered if an existing binary matches the source file hash which is embedded in the binary
    file and the Graphcore SDK version hash matches the binary which is included in the binary filename.

    `cppimport` is used to compile the source which uses a special comment in the C++ file that includes the
    compilation parameters. Here is an example of such a comment which defines compiler flags, additional sources files
    and library options (see `cppimport` documentation for more info):

    ```
    /*
    <%
    cfg['sources'] = ['another_source.cpp']
    cfg['extra_compile_args'] = ['-std=c++14', '-fPIC', '-O2', '-DONNX_NAMESPACE=onnx', '-Wall']
    cfg['libraries'] = ['popart', 'poplar', 'popops', 'poputil', 'popnn']
    setup_pybind11(cfg)
    %>
    */
    ```

    Additionally the function has a safeguard against multiple processes trying to compile the source at the same time.
    When compilation is triggered the process obtains a file-lock preventing other processes to try and compile the same
    source. The file-lock is located in the same directory as the source file to also prevent processes on different
    systems from doing the same. Once one of the processes compiles the source, all processes can load the same binary
    file.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): File path of the C++ source file
        timeout (int): Timeout time if cannot obtain lock to compile the source

    Returns:
        lib: library instance. Output of `ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary`
